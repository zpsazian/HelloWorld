# HelloWorld (macOS)

A minimal macOS SwiftUI application with a simple user interface that greets the user.

## Requirements

- macOS 13 or newer
- Xcode or Swift toolchain with Swift Package Manager

## Build and run

```sh
swift run HelloWorld
```

## What you'll see

The app opens a window that displays "Hello, World!" and a button. Clicking the button updates the greeting text.

## Resolving merge conflicts

If git reports conflicts in `README.md` or `Sources/HelloWorld/main.swift`, keep the SwiftUI app description in this README and the `@main` SwiftUI entry point in `main.swift`, then remove any conflict markers before rebuilding.
